# Masters-of-Data-Science-Capstone
The Capstone project provides an opportunity for students to carry out independent research toward the end of their studies, utilising knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course of the Masters degree.

## Background
I was fortunate to have been accepted into an industry partner Capstone program at a leading AI research and development startup Strong Compute. My research focussed on model architecture optimisation using a meta-parameter scheme which enabled Neural Architecture Search (NAS) using Bayesian Optimisation of Gaussian Process controller models. The family of computer vision models developed through this work were based on EfficientNet, and achieved performance surpassing the EfficientNet benchmark model on the CIFAR-100 dataset.
